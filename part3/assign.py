    1. This function should take the name of a .txt input file in the format indicated in the assignment.
    2. It should return a dictionary with the following keys:
        - "assigned-groups" : a list of groups assigned by the program, each consisting of usernames separated by hyphens
        - "total-cost" : total cost (time spent by instructors in minutes) in the group assignment
    3. Do not add any extra parameters to the solver() function, or it will break our grading and testing code.
    4. Please do not use any global variables, as it may cause the testing code to fail.
    5. To handle the fact that some problems may take longer than others, and you don't know ahead of time how
       much time it will take to find the best solution, you can compute a series of solutions and then
       call "yield" to return that preliminary solution. Your program can continue yielding multiple times;
       our test program will take the last answer you 'yielded' once time expired.
