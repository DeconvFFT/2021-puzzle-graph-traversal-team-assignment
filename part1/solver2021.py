    1. This function should return the solution as instructed in assignment, consisting of a list of moves like ["R2","D2","U1"].
    2. Do not add any extra parameters to the solve() function, or it will break our grading and testing code.
       For testing we will call this function with single argument(initial_board) and it should return 
       the solution.
    3. Please do not use any global variables, as it may cause the testing code to fail.
    4. You can assume that all test cases will be solvable.
    5. The current code just returns a dummy solution.
