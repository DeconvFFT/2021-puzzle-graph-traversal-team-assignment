def get_route(start, end, cost):
    
    """
    Find shortest driving route between start city and end city
    based on a cost function.

    1. Your function should return a dictionary having the following keys:
        -"route-taken" : a list of pairs of the form (next-stop, segment-info), where
           next-stop is a string giving the next stop in the route, and segment-info is a free-form
           string containing information about the segment that will be displayed to the user.
           (segment-info is not inspected by the automatic testing program).
        -"total-segments": an integer indicating number of segments in the route-taken
        -"total-miles": a float indicating total number of miles in the route-taken
        -"total-hours": a float indicating total amount of time in the route-taken
        -"total-delivery-hours": a float indicating the expected (average) time 
                                   it will take a delivery driver who may need to return to get a new package
    2. Do not add any extra parameters to the get_route() function, or it will break our grading and testing code.
    3. Please do not use any global variables, as it may cause the testing code to fail.
    4. You can assume that all test cases will be solvable.
    5. The current code just returns a dummy solution.
